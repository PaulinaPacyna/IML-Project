# IML Project

Project for the subject 'Introduction to Machine Learning'


### Prerequisites
Packages used in this project are mentioned in requirements.txt.
You can install them by `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Quick Roadmap

To scrape and preprocess your dataset, go to the src directory and run first scraper.py, then date_formatter.py and finally lemmatizer.py.

To preprocess data, run preprocessing.py in the same directory.

To see a basic cluster analysis, go to the clusters branch and run clusters.ipynb

To run math_to_count, timeseries or lda analysis, go to the src directory in the main branch and run correct files by names math_in_cs.py,
   time_series_clustering.py and lda.py respectively.
